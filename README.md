## Weather station with ESP8266

The goal of this project is to monitor, store, and show several charts of weather variables such as temperature, humidity, and air pressure. The ESP8266 microcontroller was chosen because it's very cheap, can be programed with the Arduino IDE, and it's wireless.

## Parts

- 1x ESP8266 microcontroller
- 1x BME280 sensor (temprature, humidity, and air pressure)
- 1x DS18B20 sensor (temprature only)
- 1x breadboard and jumper wires
- 1x generic micro USB phone charger

The cost of all the parts shouldn't exceed $20
